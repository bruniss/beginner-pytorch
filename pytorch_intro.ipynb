    "# Why use Machine Learning?\n",
    "\n",
    "To understand why we might want to use machine learning to solve a given problem, it's important to first understand how this problem would be solved by traditional programming. Take for example, a program designed to look at an image, and output simply whether the photo contains a bird or does not.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finding feature descriptors for even a single bird would prove difficult if not impossible. For a blue jay the following might be a start:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Blue \n",
    "- Feathered\n",
    "- Beak\n",
    "\n",
    "So first you'd have to identify a discrete shape that is blue. Then you'd have to craft something to detect blue jay feathers, and finally something to detect beaks. So lets imagine you've somehow crafted a perfectly reliable blue-jay detection function that when passed a picture of a bluejay can say that it is indeed a bluejay 100% of the time. Consider these problems:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Some other birds are also blue\n",
    "- Blue-jay feathers don't look like goose feathers\n",
    "- If the image is distorted or the lighting is wrong, the parameters for blue and feather-like detectors break\n",
    "- You have to do this all over again for every single bird that exists\n",
    "\n",
    "You can see how the amount of code required to describe and classify whether a photo contains a bird or not could quickly get out of hand. In this case almost certainly impossible to code in a way that works with most images reliably.\n",
    "\n",

    "# What is a neural network? \n",
    "\n",
    "A neural network is a type of program made up of layers of simple units called neurons that are connected together. Each neuron takes in information, processes it, and passes it on to the next layer. By adjusting the connections between neurons, a neural network can learn to recognize patterns in data, like identifying objects in pictures or understanding human speech.\n",
    "\n",
    "### How do neural networks function?\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Inputs and Tensors**:\n",
    "  - A neural network takes inputs, which are numerical data, and organizes them into a matrix (or tensor). Tensors are generalized matrices that can be in multiple dimensions.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Mathematical Operations and Features**:\n",
    "  - These input tensors undergo a series of mathematical operations, such as matrix multiplications, additions, and the application of activation functions.\n",
    "  - Each layer is usually a combination of linear (straight lines) and non-linear functions.\n",
    "  - Through these operations, the network extracts patterns from the data. These patterns are often referred to as \"features.\"\n",
    "    - Also can be called embedding, feature vectors, weights, etc (not all exactly the same but all terms are used)\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Weights and Representations**:\n",
    "  - The neural network learns these patterns by adjusting \"weights,\" which are the parameters within the model. Each connection between neurons in different layers of the network has an associated weight.\n",
    "  - As the input data passes through the network, these weights are applied to transform the data at each layer, gradually building a more complex representation of the input data.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Loss Function and Optimization**:\n",
    "  - The network's performance is measured using a loss function, which quantifies the difference between the network's predictions and the actual target values.\n",
    "  - During training, an optimization algorithm (such as gradient descent) adjusts the weights to minimize the loss function. The goal is to find the optimal set of weights that result in the lowest possible loss, indicating that the model is making accurate predictions.\n",

    "### What is a vector?  \n",
    "\n",
    "A vector is a mathematical object that has both magnitude (length) and direction. \n",
    "\n",
    "Vectors are composed of basis vectors. Basis vectors have a length of 1 in whatever unit of measurement your vector is in (e.g., millimeters, miles per hour) and point in the standard directions of the vector space (e.g., along the x, y, and z axes in 3D space). \n",
    "\n",
    "A vector component is measured by projecting the vector onto the axes. For example, to find the X component, imagine shining a flashlight along the X axis. The shadow of the vector on this axis is the X component. The Y component is the number of basis vectors needed to reach the tip of the vector along the Y axis. \n",
    "\n",
    "In other words, the components are the amounts of the basis vectors required to span from the vector's start to its end along each axis, representing its \"width\" and \"height.\" \n",

    "Once you have the components of a vector, you can represent the vector solely using these components. For instance, a vector v in 2D space with components v_x and v_y can be written as: \n",
    "\n",
    "v = v_x * i + v_y * j \n",
